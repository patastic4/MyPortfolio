										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p> 
											Hello again! My name is Patrick Chan and I am currently only begining my adventure in programming.
											I first stumbled onto programming during my computer course in highschool. I later declared it as my major at Chabot Community 
											College, where I was able to excel in my studies while also working with incredible people in our Engineering and Computer Science
											club. After my time at Chabot, I transferred and completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at University of California-Davis, while 
											also receiving a minor in History (my other passion), and making the Deans list! Moving on, here are some of my skills:

										<h2 class="major">Educational Background</h2>
										<!-- shorten begining fix The and add minor might not need first sentance, not things concept-->
										<p>
											Throughout college, I had many different exposures to concepts like machine learning, relational databases, algorithms, OOP, software 
											engineering practices and standards, and computer graphics. During my time at UC Davis, I also fell in love with History, especially 
											Middle Eastern history. I had the chance to work in many teams which allowed me to build on my communication 
											and interpersonal skills. In addition, I learned to improve on my time management skills, creativity, and critical thinking. All said 
											and done, I cherished my time as an undergraduate student and hope to continue my journey in Computer Science!

										<h2 class="major">Technical Background</h2>
										<p>Most recently, I was able to spend some time at Nisum where I was able to partake in an Agile environment in which I worked in a team 
											to develop a marketplace application. I developed a shopping grid, created APIs to update our inventory database, worked on updating/displaying 
											order status, created endpoints to access/update the database, and deployed simple account authorization.

										<h2 class="major">LStore database</h2>
										<p>The goal of this project was to replicate a Lineage-Based Data Store (L-Store) created by our Professor Mohammad Sadoghi.
											L-Store aims to manage data that is constantly being updated and at the same time analyzes large sets of data, using a
											lineage-based storage architecture. My team and I produced the architecture of the database from the ground up. We designed 
											pages to store data, special flags to communicate information, how the data was stored to durable memory, a Bufferpool 
											with a LRU policy, and strict 2PL locking. You can read more about this Database and its design here.<br>

										<h2 class="major">The Sultans of Suggestion</h2>
										<p>This game genre is a roguelike 2D bullet hell, where the player starts in a dungeon room and will progress through rooms and gain upgrades 
											until they reach the final boss. These upgrades will be represented 
											in card format with both generally positive options as well as other options that are more chaotic and have some 
											negative effect. Mobs that must be slain to progress will spawn in rooms as the player progresses, slowly ascending 
											in difficulty as they approach the boss. For this project, my team and I used primarily Unity scripting along with certain
											design patterns to help keep our code clean. On the creative side, we pulled some asset templates and also created some orginal pixel art
											along with a totally original soundtrack!

										<h2 class="major">Credit Card Approval</h2>
										<p>My team and I proposed a machine learning model to help applicants gauge their credit worthiness before applying for a credit card, 
											helping them avoid an unnecessary credit score drop from a hard pull on their credit report. In this project, we trained four supervised 
											learning models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost(Decision Tree), Multi-layer Perception, and a Support Vector Machine(SVM). 
											You can read more about our findings in the paper linked below!
