										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>Hello again! My name is Patrick Chan and I am currently only begining my adventure into programming.
											I first stumbled onto programming at Chabot College, and would later complete my Bachelors in 
											Computer Science at The Univeristy of California-Davis while also minoring in History (my other passion). 
											Here are some of the technologies I have become comfortable with

										<h2 class="major">Educational Background</h2>
										<p>As I might have mentioned I recently graduated from The University of California-Davis, with a major in Computer Science.
											Here I had many different exposures to things like machine learning, Relational Databases, Algorithims, OOP, Software Enginerring
											Practices and standards, and computer graphics. However, during my time at UC Davis I also fell in love with Histroy. Especially, Middle
											Eastern history. During my studies in both CS and History I got to work with some wonderful smart people and perservered with some who were
											less cooperative. Nevertheless, I cherised my time at Davis and hope to continue my journey in Computer Science!

										<h2 class="major">Technical Background</h2>
										<p>Most recently I was able to spend some time at Nisum where I was able to partake in a agile environment
											in which me and several other coworkers developed a Marketplace applicaition. Personally I was responsible for
											developing a shopping grid, updating inventory database after purchase, updating/displaying order status, creating endpoints to
											access/update the database, and account authorization.

										<p>The overall goal of this project was to replicate the Lineage-based Data Store(L-Store) created by our Professor Mohammad Sadoghi.
											A database that aims to manage data that is constantly being updated and at the same time analyzing large sets of data, using a
											lineage-based storage architecture. You can read more about this Database and its design here<br>

										<h2 class="major">The Sultans of Suggestion</h2>
										<p>The game genre is a roguelike 2D bullet hell game, where the player starts in a dungeon room and needs to beat the boss. 
											The player will progress through rooms and gain upgrades until they reach the final boss. These upgrades will be represented 
											in card format and there will both be generally positive options as well as other options that are more chaotic and have some 
											extra kind of negative effect. Mobs that must be slain to progress will spawn in rooms as the player progresses, slowly ascending 
											in difficulty as they approach the boss.

										<h2 class="major">Credit Card Approval</h2>
										<p>Here my group and I proposed a machine learning model to help applicants gauge their credit worthiness before applying for a 
											credit card, helping them avoid an unnecessary credit score drop from a hard pull on their credit report. In this project we trained
											four supervised learning models; Logistic Regression, XGBoost(Decision Tree), Multi-layer Perception, and a Support Vector Machine(SVM).
											You can read more about our findings in the paper linked below!
