										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>Hello again! My name is Patrick Chan and I am currently only begining my adventure into programming.
											I first stumbled onto programming at Chabot College, and would later complete my Bachelors in 
											Computer Science at The Univeristy of California-Davis while also minoring in History (my other passion). 
											Here are some of the technologies I have become comfortable with

										<h2 class="major">Educational Background</h2>
										<p>As I might have mentioned I recenlt graduated from The University of California-Davis, with a major in Computer Science.
											Here I had many different exposures to things like machine learning, Relational Databases, Algorithims, OOP, Software Enginerring
											Practices and standards, and computer graphics. However, during my time at UC Davis I also fell in love with Histroy. Especially, Middle
											Eastern history. During my studies in both CS and History I got to work with some wonderful smart people and perservered with some who were
											less cooperative. Nevertheless, I cherised my time at Davis and hope to contiune my journey in Computer Science!

										<h2 class="major">Technical Background</h2>
										<p>Most recently I was able to spend some time at Nisum where I was able to partake in a agile environment
											in which me and several other coworkers developed a Marketplace applicaition. Personally I was responsible for
											developing a shopping grid, updating inventory database after purchase, updating/displaying order status, creating endpoints to
											access/update the database, and account authorization.

										<h2 class="major">The Sultans of Suggestion</h2>
										<p>the game genre is a roguelike 2D bullet hell game, where the player starts in a dungeon room and needs to beat the boss. 
											The player will progress through rooms and gain upgrades until they reach the final boss. These upgrades will be represented 
											in card format and there will both be generally positive options as well as other options that are more chaotic and have some 
											extra kind of negative effect. Mobs that must be slain to progress will spawn in rooms as the player progresses, slowly ascending 
											in difficulty as they approach the boss.
